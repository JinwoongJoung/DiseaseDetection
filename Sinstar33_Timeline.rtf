776499284862758900: I've always thought that the mother is covering something up, whether she did something or not. Just sticks in the back of my head.  #DrPhil (Thu Sep 15 19:13:50 +0000 2016)\

750348016662487000: A similar person would be prosecuted, but the #FBI decided she won't be?  Repeat that, perhaps I didn't understand. (Again, not w/ either!) (Tue Jul 05 15:18:02 +0000 2016)\
750346080848584700: Watching to see what the #FBI plans to do. Now, if they had only been this thorough w/ red flagged individuals. (I'm not w/ either one!) (Tue Jul 05 15:10:21 +0000 2016)\
